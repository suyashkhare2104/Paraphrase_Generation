# Custom Paraphrase Generator (CPG)

This project implements a **Custom Paraphrase Generator (CPG)** using the **conventional NLP techniques** and **T5 model** for generating paraphrases of text passages. The model is fine-tuned on the **Quora Question Pairs dataset** and evaluated using industry-standard metrics such as **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, and **METEOR**. The application generates paraphrases for passages of 200-400 words.
## Features

- **Custom Paraphrase Generator**: Used conventional NLP techniques and Fine-tuned T5 model to generate paraphrases.
- **Comparison**: Can be compared with LLM-based generators like GPT for performance and quality.
- **Evaluation**: Provides evaluation of paraphrased text using BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics.
